    The Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement tool refers to two
    things: a set of molecular mechanical force fields for the simulation of
    biomolecules (which are in the public domain, and are used in a variety of
    simulation programs); and a package of molecular simulation programs which
    includes source code and demos.

    Software package specially developed for the study of genesâ€™ primary
    structure. It uses gene sequences downloaded from public databases, as FASTA
    and GenBank, and it applies a set of statistical and visualization methods
    in different ways, to reveal information about codon context, codon usage,
    nucleotide repeats within open reading frames (ORFeome) and others.

    This tool can get annotation for a generic set of IDs, using the
    Bioconductor annotation data packages. Supported organisms are human, mouse,
    rat, fruit fly and zebrafish. The org.db packages that are used here are
    primarily based on mapping using Entrez Gene identifiers. More information
    on the annotation packages can be found at the Bioconductor website, for
    example, information on the human annotation package (org.Hs.eg.db) can be
    found here.
