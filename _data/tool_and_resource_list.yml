    The Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement tool refers to two
    things: a set of molecular mechanical force fields for the simulation of
    biomolecules (which are in the public domain, and are used in a variety of
    simulation programs); and a package of molecular simulation programs which
    includes source code and demos.
